# ASR
## Description
A collection of scripts for speech recognition based on [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) and meant to simplify the training process as much as possible.

### Speech Recognition
- 1. Data prep
- 2. Lexicon generation
- 3. Grammar generation (pocolm & srilm)
- 4. Feature extraction
- 5. HMM-GMM training
- 6. Data augmentation (speed, volume, reverb, music, noise, babble)
- 7. Embedding (i-vector, x-vector)
- 8. DNN training
- 9. RNNLM training
- 10. Rescoring
